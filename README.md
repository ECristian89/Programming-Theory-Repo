# Programming-Theory-Repo  
## Monsters and Castles
>   ***prototype game, management, strategy***

## Purpose
>This prototype was made by myself as a finisher project for the Junior Programmer Path final submission. I have applied most of the concepts I learnt throughout the course, and focused on the OOP principles while building a decent prototype base.

>I plan to expand this in the future and create a full-fledged game (or games) and share the experience of it with others that take this path.
